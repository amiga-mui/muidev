This GitHub repository is a public site for organizing and maintaining the development of the so-called _Magic User Interface_ (MUI) for AmigaOS-driven computer systems. While the services and information on these pages are mainly focused for the developers of the AmigaOS port of MUI only, it also provides online [API documentation](https://github.com/amiga-mui/muidev/wiki/autodocs/autodocs.md) targeted for interested software developers using MUI. In addition, for end-users wanting to enhance their MUI experience, this site provides updates as well as online documentation and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Even more important every developer and end-user using MUI is invited to report bugs and request enhancements by using the public ticket management system.
